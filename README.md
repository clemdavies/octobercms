# My first octoberCMS project

[OctoberCMS](http://octobercms.com) is a Content Management System built on laravel 4 framework.

Laravel 4 is amazing to develop with and october cms is a very developer friendly cms to use both on the website admin side and the code backend.
All pluginsI develop for OctoberCMS that I deem useful to be released will be released to the community.
Regardless the code is here for stealing from anyway.

## Website Features

* Various feeds from:
  * Steam
  * Twitter
  * Github
  * Guides (see below)
  * Showcase (see below)
* Some walkthroughs or guides to various web development aspects.
  * Percentage based LESS/CSS responsive grid/column system.
* A showcase area for little projects I work on as a hobby.
  * Tetris AI program
  * Jquery plugins

More to come as I constantly come up with new ideas and projects.
